        <span className="high">CodeLighthouse</span> is my Bachelor's thesis that I have developed
        and documented in 2024 in order to finish my Undergraduate studies.
    </p>
    <p>
        Automated Online Assessments Platform (referred to as CodeLighthouse) is a web application
        that allows users to hone their coding skills in a pleasant and community-based way. The users
        are able to check their proposed solutions for coding challenges that are offered by the
        application, directly in their browser. The platform offers automatic solution verifying.
    </p>
    <p>
        In addition, the application offers support for creating groups of people (referred to as
        Lighthouses) that can either be Private (joining will be done with the help of a randomly
        generated code), or Public (referred to as Communities in the following). The enrollment
        code of a community is public and can be used to join the group. One proposed usage scenario
        for communities is to be used as a way of checking out what certain institutions are up to,
        for example: Universities or Big tech companies (via interview questions).
    </p>
    <p>
        Running contests on the platform is also possible. An admin can create either a private contest
        and upload a custom participants list to then have accounts automatically created and sent
        (via e-mail) to each and every one of them or a public contest (open contest), that allows any
        user on the platform to participate. One identified usage scenario is for tech companies that
        want to run talent acquisition-like campaigns.
    </p>
    <p>
        The solution is initially presented from an architectural perspective that is followed by
        the features and use cases of the application.

    <p>I have designed and developed the application that competitors will interact with after retrieving the secrets using the robots. These users are called the <span class="high">human players.</span></p>
    
    <p>The application consists of 4 different mini-games that human players must solve quickly while using a game manual to reveal some secrets.</p>
    <p>All of the 4 mini-games were designed and developed entirely by me.</p>
    
    <p><span class="high">These include:</span></p>
    <ul>
        <li>"Alchemy" - a game where you must combine different elements to try and obtain a target one.</li>
        <li>"Papers please!" - a game where you are given a gem and must determine whether it is authentic or fake by running some tests with given tools and comparing their results to your handbook.</li>
        <li>"Bomb defusal" - a game where you are given the connectors of a bomb and 4 buttons that must be pressed in a certain order influenced by the wire connections.</li>
        <li>"Space diplomat" - a game where two factions collide and demand some resources. Based on your available resources, you must decide on 3 possible actions based on the game manual.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>The games were designed to be solvable in 15-30 seconds if the manual was studied prior to the game.</p>
    
    <p>Whenever a game is completed, a piece of a secret is revealed and the players are then returned to the home page where they are prompted to enter a new code. If the code is correct, they will be given a new mini-game to solve.</p>

<p>Throughout the week I had the honour of discussing various details related to the website with the international partners at the first meeting of the project that was held at WUT.</p>

<p>The Website was developed in collaboration with the project Manager: Isabela DrÄƒmnesc.</p>`,
    `This project was built in collaboration with <span class="high">Nokia Romania.</span>
Personally I created the front-end of the app while being the leader of a team composed of 2 other people. The back-end was created by my colleagues.
The project involved more than just coding. It involved the entire <span class="high">SDLC scheme:</span>
<ul>
<li>Requirements</li>
<li>Design</li>
<li>Testing</li>
</ul>

Tech used in the front-end:
<ul>
<li>React JS.</li>
</ul>
In the back-end:
<ul>
<li>Java Spring</li>
</ul>

<span class="high">Features:</span>

            <p>While learning Web Development I have design and developed a plethora of landing pages to get a good <span class="high">grip</span>
            of how CSS and JS work.      </p>      
            <p>Some of my best works include:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>DelDrone</li>
            <li>Space | Planets | Life</li>

            <p>As a bachelor student, I chose to develop educational apps for most of my semester projects.</p>
            <p>These include:</p>

            <li><a href="https://sortalgs.stefansecrieru.com">SortAlgs</a> - Visualize sorting algorithms</li>

    `<p><span class="high">(June 2024)</span></p>
<p>
I created another script for automating the process of verifying the date of the last possible day to grade students in the electronic catalogue and sending e-mails as reminders.</p>

<p><span class="high">(July - September 2023)</span></p>
<p>As a WEB Administrator for FMI WUT I also developed 3 Google Scripts that help the University Infocentre in managing e-mails for a large amount of incoming requests.</p>
<p><span class="high">The 3 scripts include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Automatic e-mail sender and custom view of the student's data for applications for re-registration.</li>
<li>Automatic e-mail sender and custom view of the student's data for schooling extension requests.</li>
<li>Automatic e-mail sender and custom view of the student's data for repeating studies requests.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="high">The scripts: </span></p>
<ul>
<li>Can run through multiple Google Sheet files from your Drive and multiple sheets that each file may have. This way, one script will account for all 12 faculties (each with its own file) of the University.</li>
<li>Verify certain conditions for multiple columns of a Google Sheet. </li>
<li>Account for unexpected errors that may occur and retry to send the e-mails the next time they are run.</li>
<li>Verify more than one sheet on the provided Google Sheet. (e.g: Master students, Bachelor students)</li>
<li>Take into account that the rows may not all be in the same state (e.g: some may be at step one (as they were just added) while others may be at step 3).</li>
<li>Provide error handling to account for misspelling sheet / file names. (e.g: the script will not crash if you misspell a file name)</li>
</ul>
<p>The scripts were designed to be used with an automatic trigger that will keep running them to watch for new data that may have appeared.</p>

<p><span class="high">Tech stack used:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>JavaScript</li>
<li>Google Scripts APIs</li>
</ul>
<p>This project was done in collaboration with the head of the infocentre who provided all of the data necessary.</p>`,
    `<p><span class="high">Date: Sep - Jan 2023</span></p>
<p>Final result can be seen <a href="https://shopnall.stefansecrieru.com">here</a>.</p>
<p>This massive E-Commerce website was created using React, Redux, React-Router, and many more other technologies.</p>
<p><span class="high">Features of the app:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Add items to cart.</li>
<li>Cart dropdown.</li>
<li>Checkout page.</li>
<li>Change quantity of items in the checkout page.</li>
<li>Real time calculations regarding your total.</li>
